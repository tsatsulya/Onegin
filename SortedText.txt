'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, 280
'Tis strange. 80
'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
(As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
(Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
(O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
A double blessing is a double grace;
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, 305
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
A sable silver'd.
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."

Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me. Exit.
Against the which a moiety competent
Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
All my smooth body.
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
All. Our duty to your honour.
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
An understanding simple and unschool'd; 300
And I am sick at heart. 10
And I believe it is a fetch of warrant. 990
And I with them the third night kept the watch;
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away 430
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all, 465
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
And carriage of the article design'd,
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
And draw you into madness? Think of it.
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
And each particular hair to stand on end 755
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
And foreign mart for implements of war; 90
And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
And hears it roar beneath.
And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth 525
And in the porches of my ears did pour
And it must follow, as the night the day, 565
And keep you in the rear of your affection,
And lay your hands again upon my sword.
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this. 45
And let us once again assail your ears,
And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
And makes each petty artire in this body
And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
And prey on garbage. 795
And prologue to the omen coming on, 140
And recks not his own rede. 535
And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
And so, without more circumstance at all,
And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands 120
And that in way of caution- I must tell you
And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again, 330
And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
And there assume some other, horrible form 705
And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
And these few precepts in thy memory
And they in France of the best rank and station
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
And thy best graces spend it at thy will! 265
And thy commandment all alone shall live 840
And to the manner born, it is a custom
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge 825
And vanish'd from our sight.
And we beseech you, bend you to remain
And we did think it writ down in our duty
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? 370
And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
And will not let belief take hold of him
And with a larger tether may he walk
And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
And with no less nobility of love
And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
Appears before them and with solemn march 410
Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
Are most select and generous, chief in that. 560
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
As are companions noted and most known
As harbingers preceding still the fates
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
As he in his particular act and place 510
As if increase of appetite had grown
As if it some impartment did desire
As in their birth, – wherein they are not guilty,
As infinite as man may undergo-
As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
As it doth well appear unto our state,
As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
As meditation or the thoughts of love,
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
As of a father; for let the world take note
As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother, 530
As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark. [Writes.]
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
Awake the god of day; and at his warning, 175
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come. 325
Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
Before You visit him, to make inquire
Being a thing immortal as itself? 700
Being nature's livery, or fortune's star, 660
Believe so much in him, that he is young,
Bernardo. 'Tis here!
Bernardo. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
Bernardo. Have you had quiet guard?
Bernardo. He.
Bernardo. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
Bernardo. I have seen nothing.
Bernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so. 125
Bernardo. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
Bernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew. 170
Bernardo. It would be spoke to.
Bernardo. Last night of all,
Bernardo. Long live the King!
Bernardo. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio. 55
Bernardo. Say-
Bernardo. See, it stalks away!
Bernardo. Sit down awhile, 40
Bernardo. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
Bernardo. Well, good night.
Bernardo. Who's there?
Break we our watch up; and by my advice
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell, 670
But I have that within which passeth show-
But answer made it none. Yet once methought
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!
But come!
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment 550
But do not go with it!
But even then the morning cock crew loud,
But he's an arrant knave.
But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
But let me hear from you. 485
But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
But mere implorators of unholy suits,
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
But this eternal blazon must not be
But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
But to my mind, though I am native here
But to recover of us, by strong hand
But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
But what is your affair in Elsinore? 380
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
But you must know, your father lost a father;
But you'll be secret?
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips 970
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me! —
By indirections find directions out.
By laboursome petition, and at last
By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion, 655
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
By this encompassment and drift of question
By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
Claudius. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, 290
Claudius. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
Claudius. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
Claudius. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
Claudius. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
Claudius. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
Claudius. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
Come hither, gentlemen, 910
Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
Consent to swear.
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Cornelius.[with Voltemand] In that, and all things, will we show our duty. 240
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands 105
Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star 135
Do I impart toward you. For your intent 315
Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them? 590
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, 195
Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal. 665
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
Drabbing. You may go so far. 975
Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
Exeunt.
Exeunt.
Exeunt.
Exeunt.
Exit Ghost.
Exit.
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
Father's Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, 780
Father's Ghost. I am thy father's spirit, 745
Father's Ghost. I find thee apt;
Father's Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
Father's Ghost. Mark me.
Father's Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
Father's Ghost. My hour is almost come,
Father's Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing 740
Father's Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
Father's Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
Father's Ghost. Swear.

Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, Voltemand, Cornelius, Lords, and Attendants].
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway, 235
For every man hath business and desire,
For food and diet, to some enterprise
For he himself is subject to his birth.
For it is as the air, invulnerable,
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
For nature crescent does not grow alone 495
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
For they are actions that a man might play;
For what we know must be, and is as common
For your desire to know what is between us,
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting; 490
Francisco. Bernardo hath my place.
Francisco. Bernardo? 5
Francisco. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
Francisco. Give you good night. 20
Francisco. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
Francisco. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
Francisco. Not a mouse stirring.
Francisco. You come most carefully upon your hour.
From me, whose love was of that dignity
From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
From the first corse till he that died to-day,
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
Gertrude. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off, 270
Gertrude. If it be,
Gertrude. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
Ghost beckons Hamlet.
Ghost cries under the stage.
Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
Give it an understanding but no tongue.
Give me one poor request.
Give you good night. Exit.
Given private time to you, and you yourself
Giving more light than heat, extinct in both 605
Giving to you no further personal power
Go on. I'll follow thee.
God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant 110
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
Hamlet. 'Tis very strange.
Hamlet. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
Hamlet. Alas, poor ghost!
Hamlet. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
Hamlet. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
Hamlet. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
Hamlet. Arm'd, say you?
Hamlet. Ay, madam, it is common.
Hamlet. Ay, marry, is't;
Hamlet. But where was this?
Hamlet. Did you not speak to it?
Hamlet. For God's love let me hear!
Hamlet. From top to toe?
Hamlet. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift 765
Hamlet. He was a man, take him for all in all.
Hamlet. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
Hamlet. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
Hamlet. His beard was grizzled- no?
Hamlet. Hold off your hands! 715
Hamlet. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it? 865
Hamlet. I am glad to see you well.
Hamlet. I am sorry they offend you, heartily; 880
Hamlet. I am very glad to see you. – [To Bernardo] Good even, sir. —
Hamlet. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
Hamlet. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
Hamlet. I will watch to-night. 460
Hamlet. I will. 735
Hamlet. I would I had been there.
Hamlet. I would not hear your enemy say so,
Hamlet. If it assume my noble father's person,
Hamlet. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
Hamlet. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
Hamlet. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
Hamlet. It waves me still.
Hamlet. It will not speak. Then will I follow it. 695
Hamlet. Murther?
Hamlet. My fate cries out
Hamlet. Nay, but swear't.
Hamlet. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
Hamlet. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
Hamlet. No, you will reveal it.
Hamlet. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
Hamlet. O God! 760
Hamlet. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else? 830
Hamlet. O my prophetic soul!
Hamlet. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
Hamlet. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
Hamlet. Pale or red?
Hamlet. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
Hamlet. Saw? who?
Hamlet. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
Hamlet. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
Hamlet. So be it! 855
Hamlet. Speak. I am bound to hear.
Hamlet. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse, 635
Hamlet. The King my father?
Hamlet. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
Hamlet. Then saw you not his face?
Hamlet. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
Hamlet. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
Hamlet. Upon my sword.
Hamlet. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
Hamlet. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast? 915
Hamlet. What hour now?
Hamlet. What, look'd he frowningly. 445
Hamlet. What?
Hamlet. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
Hamlet. Why, right! You are in the right!
Hamlet. Why, what should be the fear?
Hamlet. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
Hamlet. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
Hamlet.[aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
Hamlet
Hamlet
Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous. 580
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy, 210
Have you so slander any moment leisure 620
Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes 995
He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
He closes with you in this consequence:
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
His further gait herein, in that the levies,
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
Hold you the watch to-night?
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
Holds such an enmity with blood of man
Horatio! – or I do forget myself.
Horatio. 'Tis here!
Horatio. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
Horatio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
Horatio. A piece of him.
Horatio. A truant disposition, good my lord. 375
Horatio. And then it started, like a guilty thing
Horatio. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
Horatio. As thou art to thyself. 75
Horatio. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
Horatio. Before my God, I might not this believe
Horatio. Do not, my lord!
Horatio. Do, if it will not stand.
Horatio. Friends to this ground.
Horatio. Good my lord, tell it.
Horatio. Hail to your lordship! 365
Horatio. Have after. To what issue will this come?
Horatio. He waxes desperate with imagination. 725
Horatio. Heaven secure him!
Horatio. Heaven will direct it.
Horatio. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
Horatio. I think it lacks of twelve.
Horatio. I warr'nt it will.
Horatio. In faith,
Horatio. In what particular thought to work I know not;
Horatio. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon. 385
Horatio. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
Horatio. Is it a custom? 640
Horatio. It beckons you to go away with it,
Horatio. It is a nipping and an eager air.
Horatio. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
Horatio. It would have much amaz'd you.
Horatio. Look, my lord, it comes!
Horatio. Most constantly. 450
Horatio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
Horatio. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
Horatio. My lord, I did; 425
Horatio. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
Horatio. My lord, the King your father.
Horatio. Nay, very pale.
Horatio. No, by no means!
Horatio. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
Horatio. Not when I saw't.
Horatio. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
Horatio. O, where, my lord?
Horatio. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
Horatio. Propose the oath, my lord. 905
Horatio. Season your admiration for a while 400
Horatio. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
Horatio. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak! 65
Horatio. That can I.
Horatio. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
Horatio. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave 870
Horatio. There's no offence, my lord.
Horatio. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
Horatio. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
Horatio. Two nights together had these gentlemen 405
Horatio. Well, sit we down,
Horatio. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
Horatio. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
Horatio. What is't, my lord? We will. 890
Horatio. What news, my lord?
Horatio. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
Horatio.[within] My lord, my lord!
How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
I do beseech you give him leave to go.
I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
I have sworn't. 850
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
I made to her in marriage, and to decline
I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
I say, away! – Go on. I'll follow thee.
I shall not look upon his like again. 395
I stay too long. But here my father comes.
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well. 470
I would know that.
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
I'll cross it, though it blast me. – Stay illusion! 145
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
I'll visit you.
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
If there be any good thing to be done,
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
If with too credent ear you list his songs,
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
Importing the surrender of those lands
In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
In filial obligation for some term
In going back to school in Wittenberg,
In honourable fashion.
In obstinate condolement is a course
In the dead vast and middle of the night
In the most high and palmy state of Rome, 130
In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
In this distracted globe. Remember thee? 835
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Is by a forged process of my death
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
Is not this something more than fantasy?
Is the main motive of our preparations,
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you. 885
It is most retrograde to our desire;
It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
It lifted up it head and did address
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
It waves you to a more removed ground.
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
Laertes. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well 570
Laertes. Farewell. Exit.
Laertes. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
Laertes. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
Laertes. My dread lord,
Laertes. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
Laertes. O, fear me not!
Laertes. Think it no more.
Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
Let it be tenable in your silence still;
Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell 675
Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman! – 350
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be 820
Let us impart what we have seen to-night
Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.
Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue, 545
Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
Look you, I'll go pray.
Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
Marcellus. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
Marcellus. 'Tis gone!
Marcellus. And liegemen to the Dane.
Marcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
Marcellus. Holla, Bernardo! 25
Marcellus. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
Marcellus. How is't, my noble lord?
Marcellus. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
Marcellus. Is it not like the King?
Marcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock. 180
Marcellus. It is offended.
Marcellus. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
Marcellus. Look with what courteous action
Marcellus. Lord Hamlet!
Marcellus. My good lord!
Marcellus. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
Marcellus. Nay, let's follow him. 730
Marcellus. No, it is struck. 630
Marcellus. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
Marcellus. Nor I, my lord.
Marcellus. O, farewell, honest soldier.
Marcellus. O, wonderful! 860
Marcellus. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
Marcellus. Question it, Horatio.
Marcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan? 160
Marcellus. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
Marcellus. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
Marcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
Marcellus. We have sworn, my lord, already.
Marcellus. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night? 30
Marcellus. You shall not go, my lord.
Marcellus.[with Bernardo] Arm'd, my lord. 440
Marcellus.[with Bernardo] Longer, longer. 455
Marcellus.[with Bernardo] My lord, from head to foot.
Marcellus.[with Bernardo] We do, my lord.
Marcellus.[with Horatio] Ay, by heaven, my lord.
Marcellus.[with Horatio] My lord, we will not.
Marcellus?
Mark you,
May do t' express his love and friending to you, 940
May give his saying deed; which is no further
May sweep to my revenge.
More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust 810
Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
Must render up myself.
My custom always of the afternoon,
My father's brother, but no more like my father
My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
My father- methinks I see my father. 390
My lord, not I. 895
My tables! Meet it is I set it down 845
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
My uncle?
Nay, come, let's go together. 945
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
Never to speak of this that you have heard:
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
No more.
No reckoning made, but sent to my account
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
Nor shall you do my ear that violence
Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
Not of that dye which their investments show, 615
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
Now wears his crown.
O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there, 785
O most pernicious woman!
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,
O, speak!
Occasion smiles upon a second leave. 540
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
Of general assault.
Of his affection to me.
Of his behaviour.
Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
Of man and country- 1000
Of mine own eyes.
Of these dilated articles allow. [Gives a paper.]
Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress 230
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
Ophelia. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
Ophelia. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, 600
Ophelia. Do you doubt that?
Ophelia. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
Ophelia. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
Ophelia. I shall obey, my lord.
Ophelia. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
Ophelia. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
Ophelia. No more but so?
Ophelia. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,' 930
Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase, 595
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life 155
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open 515
Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd 335
Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son. 320
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, 220
Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
Out of the shot and danger of desire.
Passing through nature to eternity. 275
Perchance 'twill walk again.
Polonius. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well. 965
Polonius. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
Polonius. And let him ply his music.
Polonius. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to say?
Polonius. At 'closes in the consequence'– Ay, marry!
Polonius. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
Polonius. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
Polonius. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
Polonius. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
Polonius. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
Polonius. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
Polonius. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave 260
Polonius. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
Polonius. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
Polonius. Marry, well bethought!
Polonius. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
Polonius. Observe his inclination in yourself.
Polonius. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
Polonius. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you? 575
Polonius. Wherefore should you do this?
Polonius. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
Polonius. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo, 950
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth, 775
Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
Reynaldo. As gaming, my lord.
Reynaldo. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
Reynaldo. Ay, my lord,
Reynaldo. Ay, very well, my lord.
Reynaldo. But, my good lord- 985
Reynaldo. Good my lord! [Going.]
Reynaldo. I shall, my lord. 1025
Reynaldo. I will, my lord.
Reynaldo. My lord, I did intend it.
Reynaldo. My lord, I have.
Reynaldo. My lord, that would dishonour him.
Reynaldo. Very good, my lord.
Reynaldo. Well, my lord.
Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
See you now-
Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
Set your entreatments at a higher rate
Shall in the general censure take corruption
Shall you my son. You have me, have you not? 1020
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes, 115
She married. O, most wicked speed, to post 360
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
Since nature cannot choose his origin, —
Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
So excellent a king, that was to this
So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
So horridly to shake our disposition
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
So oft it chances in particular men
So to seduce! – won to his shameful lust
So, by my former lecture and advice,
So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
Speak of it! Stay, and speak! – Stop it, Marcellus!
Speak to me.
Speak to me.
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me 415
Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
Such was the very armour he had on
Swear by my sword.
Swear by my sword.
Swear.
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment. 555
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet, 610
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. 920
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. 250
Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
Than that which dearest father bears his son
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
Than your particular demands will touch it. 960
That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
That are so fortified against our story,
That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
That ever I was born to set it right!
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature 340
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
That he is open to incontinency.
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven 345
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
That looks so many fadoms to the sea 710
That may to thee do ease, and, grace to me, 150
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, 770
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
That swift as quicksilver it courses through
That they do know my son, come you more nearer
That they may seem the taints of liberty,
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
That was and is the question of these wars.
That we with wisest sorrow think on him
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
That youth and observation copied there,
That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly 980
That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
That, if again this apparition come,
Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
The apparition comes. I knew your father. 420
The bell then beating one- 50
The better to beguile. This is for all:
The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
The canker galls the infants of the spring
The chariest maid is prodigal enough 520
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
The form of plausive manners, that these men
The glowworm shows the matin to be near
The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
The head is not more native to the heart,
The inward service of the mind and soul
The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
The leperous distilment; whose effect
The lists, and full proportions are all made
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
The natural gates and alleys of the body, 805
The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike, 185
The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
The pith and marrow of our attribute. 650
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste. 15
The safety and health of this whole state, 505
The serpent that did sting thy father's life
The source of this our watch, and the chief head
The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
The triumph of his pledge.
The very place puts toys of desperation,
The virtue of his will; but you must fear, 500
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse; 1010
Therefore I have entreated him along, 35
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride, 100
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
These hands are not more like.
They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
This above all- to thine own self be true,
This bodes some strange eruption to our state. 85
This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
This heavy-headed revel east and west 645
This marvel to you.
This present object made probation.
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
This unprevailing woe, and think of us 310
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
To business with the King, more than the scope
To cast thee up again. What may this mean 680
To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever 295
To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
To give these mourning duties to your father;
To his confine; and of the truth herein
To his unmast'red importunity.
To let you know of it. 435
To make it truster of your own report
To offer it the show of violence;
To our most valiant brother. So much for him. 225
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
To put an antic disposition on), 925
To reason most absurd, whose common theme
To show my duty in your coronation, 255
To tell the secrets of my prison house, 750
To tell us this.
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
To those of mine! 790
To what I shall unfold.
To you alone. 690
To youth and liberty.
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief, 285
Together with remembrance of ourselves.
Together with that fair and warlike form 60
Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd, 815
Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
Unto our climature and countrymen.
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill. 190
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
We do it wrong, being so majestical,
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
What I have said to you.
What company, at what expense; and finding
What does this mean, my lord?
What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
What is between you? Give me up the truth. 585
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
What think you on't? 70
What we two nights have seen.
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
What, is Horatio there ?
When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
Where we shall find him most conveniently.
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
Who hath reliev'd you?
Who is't that can inform me? 95
Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Why seems it so particular with thee?
Why should we in our peevish opposition
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Why this same strict and most observant watch
Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
Will sate itself in a celestial bed
William Shakespeare
With all my imperfections on my head.
With all my love I do commend me to you;
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
With an attent ear, till I may deliver
With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
With juice of cursed hebona in a vial, 800
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls? 685
With us to watch the minutes of this night,
With which she followed my poor father's body
With windlasses and with assays of bias,
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd
Within the book and volume of my brain,
Without more motive, into every brain
Without the sensible and true avouch
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle; 355
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
Yea, from the table of my memory
Yes, faith, heartily.
Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature 205
You are the most immediate to our throne,
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane 245
You do not understand yourself so clearly
You laying these slight sullies on my son
You must not put another scandal on him,
You must not take for fire. From this time
You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
You, as your business and desires shall point you, 875
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth; 1015
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone 215
Your leave and favour to return to France;
Your party in converse, him you would sound,
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
[A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.]
[Enter Ghost again.]
[Enter Polonius. ]
[Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.]
[Exeunt [all but Hamlet].] 475
